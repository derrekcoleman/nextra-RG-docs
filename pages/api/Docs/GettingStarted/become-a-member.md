To advance from an Apprentice to a Member, you will need to be Championed by an existing Raid Guild Member. This can be seen in the Guild HQ <span class='channels'>#champions</span> channel and will be brought up during the Round Table by the Member looking to champion you.

Once you’ve been Championed, you are eligible to level up from an Apprentice to a Member - signalled by 100 Shares as opposed to 1.

Follow the Proposal Process and use the Membership Proposal to request the difference in Shares to get to your 100 Share cap in [Raid Guild DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xfe1084bc16427e5eb7f13fc19bcd4e641f7d571f).

Please note that all new members are capped at 100 Shares for 500 wxDAI.

Once you’ve received 100 Shares, you’ll be given access to member-exclusive channels and are now an official member ready to Join a Raid.
